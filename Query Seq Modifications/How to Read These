The number and decimal before the colon is the sequence number and the copy number
(Ex 1.2 means first query sequence, second copy)
After colon it says index and what the modification was 
(Ex 5 to _ means fifth nuc deleted   ***a plus sign means an insert didn't think we cared ab what is inserted so I left it ambiguous***)
